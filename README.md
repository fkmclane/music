music
=====

This repository contains music I've either arranged or written. Source files in the "ly" directory are written in [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/) with built PDFs, MIDIs, and PNGs available at <https://file.fooster.io/music/ly>. In progress works are in the "wip" directory. There will be a "spi" directory soon with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) source files. Soundfonts I've made are in the "sf2" directory.
